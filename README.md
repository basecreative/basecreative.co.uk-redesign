===============

Open implementation of Base Creative's new website. It's been redesigned already, so this would just cover the front-end and back-end development.

You can check out our [timeline](http://basecreative.github.io/basecreative.eu/timeline/) and the related material.

Feel free to give any kind of feedback or learn from this code and/or material.
